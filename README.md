<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# Photo-Album <a name="about-project"></a>

**Photo-Album** is a full-stack web application that I created to enhance my skills in React and Redux. The app utilizes a JSON server to simulate data storage and allows users to add and delete photos and albums, which are generated randomly using the Faker library. To improve the user experience, the app is built with Redux, Thunks, and Redux Toolkit Query. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Photo-Album is a great tool to practice your React and Redux skills while creating a functional and enjoyable web application.
